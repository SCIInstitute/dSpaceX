Description: Discrete Morse-Smale complex approximation based on kNN graph. The Morse-Smale complex provides a decomposition of the domain. This package provides methods to compute a hierarchical sequence of Morse-Smale complicies and tools that exploit this domain decomposition for regression and visualization of scalar functions.
